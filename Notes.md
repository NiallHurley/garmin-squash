This may not be possible if you need sub-1 second precision, but like I said, I don't know much about your app. Also, I would prefer System.getTimer() over Time.now() when calculating the duration between two things, because Time.now() gives you the clock time which can change unexpectedly (although this would admittedly be a very rare edge case). System.getTimer() wraps, but it doesn't matter if you're only ever calculating the difference between
